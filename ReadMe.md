### Intro

This repository contains the implementations for several machine learning(ML) and deep learning(DL) models. These models
include simple machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision, as well as complex
deep neural networks like VGG and ResNet. The brief list of the types of models in this repo can be found [here](#list).
There are also some simple ML applications in this repo.

****

### Dependence

Most implementations require dependence of NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, and PyTorch. Some applications depend on
other libraries like OpenCV. Special requirements will be illustrated in the ReadMe files for each directory/model.
